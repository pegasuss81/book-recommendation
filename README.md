# book-recommendation

This is a book recommendation system in attempt to incorporate user's input for several factors i.e user ratings, text reviews, and book descriptions. I use Amazon review data scrawled from user reviews ranging from 1996 to 2018.

I will use Flask and Heroku to deploy the model online.
